<p>Noticed a trend lately? More and more websites are adding facebook/twitter/reddit widgets to "Share", "Like", or "Tweet" their articles. Often theses float on the side of the page as you scroll up and down, and sometimes they show up two or three times on the same page! It's getting to the point where "Share this" widgets are almost as annoying as advertisements.
</p>
<p>Miser hides these buttons as you browse the web. Miser also provides a toolbar button you can click to reveal a popup with widgets to share and view likes for the social networks of your choice, so you can like or share a page when you decide to.</p>
